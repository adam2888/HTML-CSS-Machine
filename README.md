# HTML-CSS-Machine

This is an interactive website to teach children about website structure and design.

The website consists of three boxes. One for HTML, another for CSS and a preview box. The display of these boxes can be toggled between 'show'/'hide' by clicking on the buttons on the top of the page. 

JQuery has been used to fire an update of the preview box on every keystroke, so the preview box is updated whenever the user makes a change to the HTML or CSS content. 
The width of each box is dependent on how many boxes are shown and how the large devices screen is. This is managed by using JQuery to find out the window width and how many boxes have been selected as 'show'.
